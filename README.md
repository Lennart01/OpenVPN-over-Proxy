## OpenVPN-over-Proxy
OpenVPN over Proxy[road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Ubuntu.

This script will let you set up your own VPN server HTTP proxy so you can bypass DPIs in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN or HTTP proxies before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

If you choose to install HTTP proxy, it'll setup a Squid proxy. 

## Fork
This script is based on the great work of [Nyr and its contributors](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install).

## Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

``` bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Null3rror/OpenVPN-over-HTTP/master/openvpn-over-http-install.sh -O openvpn-over-http-install.sh && bash openvpn-over-http-install.sh
```

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN over HTTP.
